    <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
    <p>History 101: Sindhu and India</p>
    <p>Your name is quite an important one. You see, the ancient Indians used to call the river we know as Indus as Sindhu.
         The Persians, living on the other side of the river, called it Hindu, as they had difficulties pronouncing 'S'. 
        The Greeks, who came after the Persians, called it Indus, from which comes India.</p>

    <p> I know, boring history lesson, but this has been one of my many adorations of you. Your name is beautiful and unique, just like you.
      Knowing you has been one of the best parts of my life. The more I learn about you, the more special you become. As the great musician Jacques Bermon Webster II quite rightly put it, "When I'm with you, I feel alive."💖 </p>
    </p>
    <p>So, once again, a very happy birthday to you, Sindhu. Thank you for being the (short) beautiful, funny, and amazing person you are, and absolutely lighting up my world.</p>
