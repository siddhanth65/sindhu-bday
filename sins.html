    <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
    <p>History 101: Sindhu and India</p>
    <p>Your name is quite an important one. You see, the ancient Indians used to call the river we know as Indus as Sindhu.
         The Persians, living on the other side of the river, called it Hindu, as they had difficulties pronouncing 'S'. 
        The Greeks, who came after the Persians, called it Indus, from which comes India.</p>

    <p> I know, boring history lesson, but this has been one of my many adorations of you. Your name in itself is so beautiful and important, that when I got to know you better(which I still am in the process of)
        it made our relation all the more special to me. </p>
    </p>
    <p>So, once again, a very happy birthday to you, and I hope you remain happy as ever.</p>
